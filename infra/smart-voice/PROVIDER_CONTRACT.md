# SMART VOICE DNA provider contract

The Voice DNA provider is intentionally a replaceable boundary.

## Request

The provider receives text plus the selected profile reference audio in memory:
- text
- language
- locale
- profileId
- referenceAudio
- referenceMimeType
- optional referenceText
- optional speakingStyle

## Response

The provider returns audio bytes and a MIME type. It may be implemented by a local GPU service, a private LAN service, or another approved inference runtime.

## Security

Use TLS outside a trusted local host, authenticate requests, avoid request-body logging, avoid persistent reference-audio storage by default, and provide profile revocation/deletion for persistent voice accounts.

The UI requires explicit voice-owner consent before personalized synthesis.

## Egyptian Arabic

VoiceTuT-TTS currently documents Egyptian-Arabic specialization, zero-shot voice cloning, code-switching, and local/self-hosted deployment. Its public repository states Apache-2.0 for the project; verify model and commercial deployment terms before production use.
## SMART TIME synthesis bridge

When `SMART_VOICE_DNA_PROVIDER_URL` is configured, authenticated SMART TIME users can call `POST /api/voice-dna/synthesize`. The server verifies profile ownership or an active share and checks the stored consent flags before forwarding the reference sample in memory to the configured provider. The sample is not persisted by the bridge.

The bridge is disabled when the provider URL is empty. The provider secret remains server-side and is never sent to the browser.
