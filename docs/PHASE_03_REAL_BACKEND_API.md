# SMART-TIME Phase 3 — Real Backend API Closure

Status: IN PROGRESS
Branch: `phase/03-real-backend-api`
Baseline: `feat/v3-next@852b87f5ce4ac3b2678d0de80c777f185da0c67e`
Date: 2026-10-01

## Goal

Close the current Express/TypeScript backend API as a real, testable HTTP boundary before AI orchestration work continues.

## Important architecture correction

The repository uses **Express + TypeScript + tsx**, not FastAPI. This phase closes the real HTTP API that already exists in `server.ts`.

## Phase 3 acceptance gates

| Gate | Requirement | Evidence | Pass condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| P3-01 | HTTP boot/health | `npm run test:phase3-api` | Server boots on a clean ephemeral port and `/api/health` returns HTTP 200 + status=ok. |
| P3-02 | Database API health | `npm run test:phase3-api` | `/api/database/health` returns HTTP 200 + status=LIVE. |
| P3-03 | Authentication boundary | `npm run test:phase3-api` | Protected AI and finance endpoints reject missing authentication with HTTP 401. |
| P3-04 | Authenticated AI status | `npm run test:phase3-api` | Trial session yields a token and authenticated `/api/ai/status` returns the SMART AI provider contract. |
| P3-05 | AI chat HTTP contract | `npm run test:phase3-api` | Authenticated `POST /api/ai/chat` returns HTTP 200 with a non-empty reply. |
| P3-06 | Finance API CRUD boundary | `npm run test:phase3-api` | Expense create returns 201; `/api/ai/state` reads it back; DELETE removes it and read-back no longer contains it. |
| P3-07 | Regression baseline | lint + existing Open Mind tests + build | All existing checks remain green. |
| P3-08 | Clean-run reproducibility | GitHub Actions | The Phase 3 workflow passes on a clean Ubuntu runner. |
| P3-09 | Security boundary | Phase 3 API gate | No tested protected endpoint performs work without a bearer token; test DB is isolated via `SMART_TIME_DB_PATH`. |
| P3-10 | Owner sign-off | sign-off record | Owner explicitly records PASS before Phase 4 is eligible. |

## Non-goals

This phase does not implement:
- AI Gateway/provider abstraction;
- general agent loop;
- final structured tool gate;
- real STT/TTS;
- Product Knowledge RAG;
- attachments/artifacts.

Those remain later phases in the canonical 35-phase order.

## Sequential governance

Phase 4 must not start until all Phase 3 technical gates and owner sign-off are PASS and the closure PR is merged into `feat/v3-next`.

## Execution note

The Phase 3 verification workflow is required to run against the final closure candidate commit. A documentation-only commit after the workflow file exists is used to ensure the workflow is picked up by GitHub Actions.
