# Phase 5 — Model / Data / Version Registry + Objective Metrics

Date: 2026-10-01
Branch: `phase/05-model-data-version-registry`

## Objective

Create one machine-readable registry for the base model, historical/current adapters, datasets, training evidence, release state, and objective evaluation metrics.

## Gates

- P5-01 Model identity: base model and adapter identities/configuration are explicit.
- P5-02 Dataset identity: training and held-out datasets point to versioned repository paths and provenance.
- P5-03 Artifact state: every candidate has an explicit release status.
- P5-04 Objective metrics: metrics have units, direction, and release thresholds.
- P5-05 Historical evidence: the V2 Kaggle run records the observed loss and generation-gate result without treating loss as release evidence.
- P5-06 Safety/data boundary: customer data, Voice DNA, and secrets remain prohibited.
- P5-07 Reproducibility: the registry verifier checks repository references and metric structure from a clean checkout.
- P5-08 No automatic activation: a candidate with a failed behavioral gate remains blocked.

## Important historical evidence

The 2026-10-01 V2 Kaggle run completed training on 746 records (596 train / 150 eval). Final eval loss was 0.12700095772743225 and final train loss was 0.2327. The generation gate was 0/120 (0.0%). Therefore this artifact is registered as `blocked_generation_gate`; the loss numbers alone are not treated as model-release evidence.

## Objective metrics

The registry defines measurable release criteria for structured output, no-fabrication behavior, confirmation boundaries, tool-argument validity, clarification validity, and secret protection. Thresholds are gates, not rankings.

## Governance

Phase 6 may begin only after this phase has implementation, tests, evidence, reproducibility, and owner sign-off all PASS. A diagnostic training result does not close a later training phase.
